Turtle Crossing Game from Day 23 of 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp
This Python Code uses Turtle Graphics to create a Turtle Crossing Game similar to the classic Frogger game. 
The user can only move forward using the "Up" key.
Once the user crosses to the other side successfully, the player goes to the next level.
At each level, the cars pick up speed. 
Cars are generated randomly.
